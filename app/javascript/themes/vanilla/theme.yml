#  (REQUIRED) The location of the pack files inside `pack_directory`.
pack:
  about: about.js
  admin: null
  common: common.js
  embed: null
  home: application.js
  public: public.js
  settings: null
  share: share.js

#  (OPTIONAL) The directory which contains the pack files.
#  Defaults to the theme directory (`app/javascript/themes/[theme]`),
#  but in the case of the vanilla Mastodon theme the pack files are
#  somewhere else.
pack_directory: app/javascript/packs

#  (OPTIONAL) Additional javascript resources to preload, for use with
#  lazy-loaded components. It is **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you
#  derive these pathnames from `themes/[your-theme]` to ensure that
#  they stay unique. (Of course, vanilla doesn't do this ^^;;)
preload:
- features/getting_started
- features/compose
- features/home_timeline
- features/notifications
